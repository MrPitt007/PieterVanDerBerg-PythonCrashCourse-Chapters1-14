1)Infinite Skills — My 3 Project Ideas 

Build a full video game (My own Alien Invasion or a 3D world)  
A game where you design:  
characters levels enemies scoring system physics upgrades  
This project uses Python + Pygame or later even Unity/Unreal. 
Exercise 1‑1 — DONE 

  
2) Create a smart home automation system 
A program that can: 
turn lights on/off 
read sensors 
manage temperature 
lock/unlock doors 
integrate with Alexa or Google Home 
This uses Python, APIs, IoT tools, and automation scripts. 
Exercise 1‑2 — DONE 

  
3) Build a website or app that helps people learn programming 
Features you could include: 
tutorials 
code execution 
quizzes 
progress tracking 
user accounts 
This uses Python + Django or Flask, which you will learn later in the book. 
Exercise 1‑3 — DONE
