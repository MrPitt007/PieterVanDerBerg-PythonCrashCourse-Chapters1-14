 7-8 Sandwiches

Make a list called 'sandwich_orders' and fill it with at least five sandwich names.
Make an empty list called 'finished_sandwiches'.
Loop through sandwich_orders and print a message for each sandwich, such as:
"I made your tuna sandwich."
As each sandwich is made, move it to finished_sandwiches.
After all sandwiches are made, print a message listing each finished sandwich.
"""


 7-9 No Pastrami

"""
Using the list from Exercise 7-8, make sure the sandwich 'pastrami' appears 
at least three times in sandwich_orders.
Print a message stating the deli has run out of pastrami.
Remove all occurrences of 'pastrami' using a while loop.
Make the remaining sandwiches as in 7-8.
"""


 7-10 Dream Vacation

"""
Write a program that polls users about their dream vacation.
Ask the user: "If you could visit one place in the world, where would you go?"
Use a while loop to allow multiple people to respond.
Store the results in a dictionary and print the poll results.

"""
In this chapter, you learned:

- The input() function allows users to provide information.
- How to work with text and numerical input.
- How to keep programs running as long as users want using while loops.
- How to use active flags, break statements, and continue statements.
- How to avoid infinite loops.
- How to process lists using while loops (moving items, cleaning lists).
- How to fill dictionaries with user input.
- How while loops work with lists and dictionaries.

Next chapter (8) introduces functions, letting you break programs
