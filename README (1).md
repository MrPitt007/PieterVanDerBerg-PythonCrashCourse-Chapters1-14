# 📘 Learning Summary: Python Crash Course (Chapters 1–14)

This README summarizes everything I learned while working through **Chapters 1–14** of *Python Crash Course*. These chapters built a strong foundation in Python and guided me through creating a complete game: **Alien Invasion** using Pygame.

---

## 🚀 Overview
From Chapters 1–14 I learned the fundamentals of Python, including **variables, lists, loops, functions, classes, file handling, and testing**. Then I applied all of these concepts to build a complete game (Alien Invasion) using **Pygame**.

I learned how to:
- Move a player-controlled ship
- Fire bullets
- Create and animate alien fleets
- Detect collisions
- Track scores, levels, and high scores
- Display remaining lives with ship icons

These chapters taught me not only Python basics, but **how to combine many concepts together into a real project**.

## 🧠 What I Learned in Each Part

### **Python Foundations (Chapters 1–11)**
- Writing and running Python programs
- Variables, strings, numbers, and basic operations
- Lists and list comprehensions
- Conditional logic with `if` statements
- Dictionaries and nested data structures
- User input and `while` loops
- Functions, arguments, and return values
- Classes, objects, and inheritance
- File handling (reading, writing, JSON)
- Error handling with exceptions
- Automated testing with `unittest`

## 🎮 Alien Invasion Game (Chapters 12–14)
### **Gameplay Mechanics**
- Creating a window using Pygame
- Drawing images (ship, aliens, bullets)
- Responding to keyboard input
- Animating sprites on the screen
- Creating an entire alien fleet
- Bullets colliding with aliens

### **Scoring System**
- Displaying the score
- Tracking and rendering the high score
- Displaying the current level
- Showing remaining lives as ship icons
- Updating the scoreboard dynamically

### **Game Progression**
- Increasing difficulty over time
- Resetting the game properly
- Handling events like ships being hit

## ⭐ Final Thoughts
These chapters gave me the skills to:
- Write clean, organized Python code
- Build larger multi‑file projects
- Use OOP principles effectively
- Create full graphical applications

Most importantly, I learned how to **think like a programmer** and break complex problems into manageable parts.
