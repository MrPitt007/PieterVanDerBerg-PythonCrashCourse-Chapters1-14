# Learning Summary: Python Crash Course (Chapters 1–14)

From Chapters 1–14 I learned the fundamentals of Python, including variables, lists, loops, functions, classes, file handling, and testing. Then I applied all of these concepts to build a complete game (Alien Invasion) using Pygame. I learned how to move a ship, fire bullets, create alien fleets, detect collisions, track scores and levels, and display lives. These chapters taught me both the basic Python skills and how to combine them into a real project.
